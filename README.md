A gallimaufry of disparate utilities useful in atomic physics that are too small and/or
simple to deserve a package of their own. The package aims to provide a consistent and
generic API for all its functionality, and also to cover the features with comprehensive
suit unit tests.

Package includes:

* **Nuclear models.** Methods for evaluating the densities and potentials for various
  spherically symmetric nuclear models, such as the point nuclear, uniform sphere and shell,
  Gaussian etc.

For more details, see [the documentation](https://juliaatoms.org/AtomicMiscellany.jl/dev).
